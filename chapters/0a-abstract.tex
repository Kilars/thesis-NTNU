\chapter*{Abstract}

Geospatial data provides valuable insights into the movement patterns of entities and people. However, as the volume of this data continues to increase, storage and transmission become more challenging. Data compression is a common solution to this problem. In this thesis, we analyze a novel reference-based and data-driven trajectory compression algorithm, \textit{REST}. This algorithm utilizes the qualities of the dataset as a whole to effectively compress each trajectory. The results are promising, but using Dynamic Time Warping as a trajectory similarity measure requires significant computational resources. Therefore, we have developed a version that significantly improves performance. The method achieves a compression ratio of five and is nine times faster than the original algorithm. Furthermore, when comparing to non reference-based methods, the results indicate that REST has a much better runtime and compression ratio.
